      New Album Review from consequenceofsound.net
    </h3>

    <p>
      Since the massive success of 2008 breakthrough Walking on a Dream, Empire of the Sun have been touring voraciously, gradually floating to the top of the international headliner circuit. The Aussie duo of Emperor Luke Steele and Lord Nick Littlemore aim to solidify that status with Two Vines, their third studio album and follow-up to 2013’s Ice on the Dune. At times, the album comes incredibly close to ’80s soundtrack pastiche (think 1985 cult classic Better Off Dead), especially on songs like “Digital Life” and “First Crush”. After repeated listens, however, that familiar comfortability proves to be the key to what Empire of the Sun have been doing all along.

      Tugging on the threads of nostalgia, Two Vines instantly catapults the listener back to a more innocent time, when playing outside until the street lights went on and watching sitcoms like Family Matters or The Cosby Show was the thing to do on a Saturday night. Co-produced by Peter Mayes (Sia, The Killers) and featuring contributions from Fleetwood Mac’s Lindsey Buckingham, Wendy Melvoin of Prince’s band the Revolution, and former David Bowie collaborators Henry Hey and Tim Lefebvre, Two Vines gains its past-leaning tone as much from its stacked guest list as from its songwriting.
